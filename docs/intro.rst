Background
----------
This technique is a tool for studying radiation belt physics, and is really only useful in that context. This introduction is written for people familiar with plasma physics and the magnetosphere, but not so much the technique.


The adiabatic invariants parameterization of phase space density (PSD) is a tool to study trapped particle motion in magnetospheres. In the adiabatic invariant parameterization of PSD, a trapped particle’s velocity is characterized by three quantities invariant over its three periodic motions (gyrations, bounce, azimuthal drift).  The invariant coordinate (μ, K, L*) is a function of the particle’s velocity, the particle’s position in space/time, and the field along the particle’s full orbit.  Provided the field along the orbit does not change too fast, the invariants are also conserved during large-scale reconfigurations of the magnetosphere. This makes them an effective underlying "state variable" of the dynamical system, obtained through a combination of observation and modeling.

The adiabatic invariants are often computed for and released with in-situ measured PSD, such as with the Radiation Belt Storm Probe (RBSP) mission. Because a mission can only measure the local field and knowledge of the non-local field is required, models of the magnetosphere are used to aid the calculation. For these purposes, semi-empirical models (such as T96, TS05) are often used. In this package, we supply tools for using magnetic field obtained from these models, as well as MHD simulations.
