This repository a library to calculate adiabatic invariants from LFM model output, as well as T96 and TS05 magnetic field models on the LFM grid. The library is provided through a python package "dasilva_invariants".

This code was developed by Daniel da Silva and Scot Elkington at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, at University of Colorado Boulder. Daniel may be contacted at [daniel.dasilva-1@colorado.edu](mailto:daniel.dasilva-1@colorado.edu) or if that doesn't work, [mail@danieldasilva.org](mailto:mail@danieldasilva.org).
