Calculation of Adiabatic Invariants
---------------------------------------

This repository a library to calculate adiabatic invariants from LFM model output, as well as T96 and TS05 magnetic field models on the LFM grid. The library is provided through a python package "dasilva_invariants".

Requirements
* [Python 3 with Miniconda/Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) - programming language, see `environment.yml` for module dependencies.

This code was developed by Daniel da Silva and Scot Elkington at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, at University of Colorado Boulder. Daniel may be contacted at [daniel.dasilva-1@colorado.edu](mailto:daniel.dasilva-1@colorado.edu) or if that doesn't work, [mail@danieldasilva.org](mailto:mail@danieldasilva.org).
